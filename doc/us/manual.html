<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install WSAPI you need to have <a href="http://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a>. Just
install the <code>wsapi</code> package. If you want FastCGI
support you need to have the <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/#TheDevKit">FastCGI dev kit</a>
installed, and use the <code>wsapi-fcgi</code> LuaRocks package. If you want Xavante support
installed use the <code>wsapi-xavante</code> LuaRocks package.</p>

<p>The WSAPI rock copies samples, docs and support files to its path inside your
local Rocks repository.</p>

<p>There is an all-in-one installer script that installs Lua, LuaRocks, and <code>wsapi-xavante</code> in
a single step. Download the <a href="http://github.com/downloads/keplerproject/wsapi/wsapi-install-1.3.0.tar.gz">tarball</a>,
unpack it, then run the provided <code>wsapi-install</code> script in its path. Run <code>wsapi-install --help</code> for
installation options.</p>

<h3>About web servers</h3>

<p>To run WSAPI applications you will also need a web server such as
<a href="http://keplerproject.github.com/xavante/">Xavante</a>,
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a>, or
<a href="http://www.iis.net/">IIS</a> (available only for Windows). Xavante is a webserver
written in pure Lua. To use the Xavante connector, install the "wsapi-xavante"
rock (it is already installed if you used the <code>wsapi-install</code> script).</p>

<h2>A Simple WSAPI Application</h2>

<p>WSAPI applications are Lua functions that take an <em>environment</em> and return
the status code, response headers and an output iterator. A very simple
application is the following:</p>


<pre class="example">
function hello(wsapi_env)
  local headers = { ["Content-type"] = "text/html" }

  local function hello_text()
    coroutine.yield("&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;Hello Wsapi!&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;PATH_INFO: " .. wsapi_env.PATH_INFO .. "&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;SCRIPT_NAME: " .. wsapi_env.SCRIPT_NAME .. "&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;")
  end

  return 200, headers, coroutine.wrap(hello_text)
end
</pre>


<p>If you have some experience with web development the example code above should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Applications usually are not implemented as naked functions, though, but packaged
inside Lua modules with a <code>run</code> function that is the entry point for WSAPI. This <code>run</code> function
is then passed to your server's WSAPI connector. The generic application launchers
provided with WSAPI respect this pattern.</p>

<p>This is how the above example would look packaged this way (for example, in a <em>hello.lua</em> file):</p>


<pre class="example">
#!/usr/bin/env wsapi.cgi

module(..., package.seeall)

function run(wsapi_env)
  local headers = { ["Content-type"] = "text/html" }

  local function hello_text()
    coroutine.yield("&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;Hello Wsapi!&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;PATH_INFO: " .. wsapi_env.PATH_INFO .. "&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;p&gt;SCRIPT_NAME: " .. wsapi_env.SCRIPT_NAME .. "&lt;/p&gt;")
    coroutine.yield("&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;")
  end

  return 200, headers, coroutine.wrap(hello_text)
end
</pre>


<p>The first line tells the UNIX-based web servers such as Apache to run WSAPI's
generic CGI launcher when executing this file as a CGI script.</p>

<h2>Running the application</h2>

<p>This step depends on your server and the connector you want to use.</p>

<h3>Xavante</h3>

<p>If you installed the <code>wsapi-xavante</code> package you already have a Xavante
launcher with WSAPI support. Just run the <code>wsapi</code> script in the path you
want as your document root, and point your browser either to the <code>hello.lua</code>
or <code>hello.ws</code> script (both extensions are treated as WSAPI applications).
See <code>wsapi --help</code> for the launcher's configuration options.</p>

<h3>UNIX-like (Apache, Lighty, etc.) CGI/FastCGI</h3>

<p>You can run <em>hello.lua</em> directly as a CGI script, through the generic CGI launcher
<em>wsapi</em>. Just give execute permission <em>hello.lua</em> and put it in a URL-accessible path with
execute permission. You should then see something like this when accessing the corresponding
<em>hello.lua</em> URL:</p>

<pre><code>    Hello Wsapi!
    PATH\_INFO: /
    SCRIPT\_NAME: /cgi-bin/hello.lua
</code></pre>

<p>The generic FastCGI launcher <em>wsapi-fcgi</em> can also run the <em>hello.lua</em> file
directly. Configuration depends on your web server, but you should tell it to run
<em>.lua</em> files as FastCGI scripts with <em>wsapi-fcgi</em> as the wrapper (the configuration
is analogous to the necessary for running PHP scripts with FastCGI). As an example,
this are the changes in <code>httpd.conf</code> for using Apache's *mod_fcgid*:</p>

<pre><code>    AddHandler fcgid-script .lua
    FCGIWrapper /usr/bin/wsapi-fcgi .lua
</code></pre>

<p>You can also run <em>hello.lua</em> through a launcher script specially tailored to it. The driver
script is very similar for both connectors. For CGI it can be this one (<em>hello.cgi</em>):</p>


<pre class="example">
#!/usr/bin/env lua

require "wsapi.cgi"
require "hello"
wsapi.cgi.run(hello.run)
</pre>


<p>For FastCGI (<em>hello.fcgi</em>):</p>


<pre class="example">
#!/usr/bin/env lua

require "wsapi.fastcgi"
require "hello"
wsapi.fastcgi.run(hello.run)
</pre>


<p>You may need to change <em>lua</em> to the name or your Lua interpreter executable.
Now flag the launcher as executable and put it in a URL-accessible path that has
execute permissions. You should see something like this when accessing the corresponding URL:</p>

<pre><code>    Hello Wsapi!
    PATH\_INFO: /
    SCRIPT\_NAME: /cgi-bin/hello.cgi
</code></pre>

<h3>Windows IIS CGI/FastCGI</h3>

<p>The generic launchers on Windows are called <em>wsapi.exe</em> and <em>wsapi-fcgi.exe</em>. You
should associate the <em>.lua</em> file extension with one of them on IIS' management console.
Then copy <em>hello.lua</em> to some URL-accessible path.</p>

<p>For CGI there is also a <em>launcher.exe</em> that you can rename to <em>hello.exe</em> and it
will run the <em>hello.cgi</em> application launcher (<strong>not</strong> the <em>hello.lua</em> application!).
Both should be in the same path, and it should be URL-accessible and have execute
permissions on IIS. You should point your browser to <em>hello.exe</em>.</p>

<h2>Writing WSAPI connectors</h2>

<p>A WSAPI connector builds the environment from information passed by the web server
and calls a WSAPI application, sending the response back to the web server.
The first thing a connector needs is a way to specify which application to run,
and this is highly connector specific. Most connectors receive the application
entry point as a parameter (but WSAPI provides special applications called
<em>generic launchers</em> as a convenience).</p>

<p>The environment is a Lua table containing the CGI metavariables (at minimum
the RFC3875 ones) plus any server-specific metainformation. It also contains
an <em>input</em> field, a stream for the request's data, and an <em>error</em> field,
a stream for the server's error log. The input field answers to the <em>read([n])</em>
method, where <em>n</em> is the number of bytes you want to read (or nil if you want
the whole input). The error field answers to the <em>write(...)</em> method.</p>

<p>The environment should return the empty string instead of nil for undefined
metavariables, and the <code>PATH\_INFO</code> variable should return "/" even if the path
is empty. Behavior among the connectors should be uniform: <code>SCRIPT\_NAME</code> should
hold the URI up to the part where you identify which application you are serving,
if applicable (again, this is highly connector specific), while <code>PATH\_INFO</code>
should hold the rest of the URL.</p>

<p>After building the environment the connector calls the application passing the environment
to it, and collecting three return values: the HTTP status code, a table with headers, and
the output iterator. The connector sends the status and headers right away to the server,
as WSAPI does not guarantee any buffering itself. After that it begins calling the iterator
and sending output to the server until it returns nil.</p>

<p>The connectors are careful to treat errors gracefully: if they occur before sending the
status and headers they return an  "Error 500" page instead, if they occur while
iterating over the response they append the error message to the response.</p>

<h2>Conveniences for application writers</h2>

<p>WSAPI is very low-level and just lets your application pretend that web servers
and gateway interfaces are similar, but it does not do any kind of processing/parsing
on the request, nor any buffering on the output. Most web applications need these
features, so we provide helper libraries to do it.</p>

<p>The first library is <em>wsapi.request</em>. This library encapsulates the environment,
parsing the request data (GET and POST) and also handling file uploads and incoming
cookies.</p>

<p>The other helper is <em>wsapi.response</em>, which offers a simpler interface (along with
buffering) for output instead of the inversion of control of the iterator. It also
lets you easily send cookies back to the browser.</p>

<p>Finally there is <em>wsapi.util</em>, which provides URI encoding/decoding and other utility
functions.</p>

<h2>WSAPI frameworks</h2>

<p>The facilities above make it easier to write applications, but still are very basic.
For more advanced web programming there are also frameworks built on top of WSAPI.
Examples would be <strong><a href="http://keplerproject.github.com/orbit">Orbit</a></strong>, which adds niceties as dispatch based on
pattern matching over the PATH_INFO, easy serving of static content, easy access
to databases, and easy page caching, and <strong>SAPI</strong>, included in the WSAPI package as the
<em>wsapi.sapi</em> application, for running <strong><a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/">CGILua</a></strong>
scripts and Lua pages.</p>

<h2>Testing WSAPI applications</h2>

<p>WSAPI comes with a mock connector that can be used for testing. It provides
methods to send requests to your application and format responses. Functionality
such as assertions and validations is left entirely to the testing framework you
choose to use. Here's a simple example of how to use the mock connector:</p>


<pre class="example">
local connector = require "wsapi.mock"

function hello(wsapi_env)
  local headers = { ["Content-type"] = "text/html" }
  local function hello_text()
    coroutine.yield("hello world!")
  end
  return 200, headers, coroutine.wrap(hello_text)
end

local app = connector.make_handler(hello)

do
  local response, request = app:get("/", {hello = "world"})
  assert(response.code                    == 200)
  assert(request.request_method           == "GET")
  assert(request.query_string             == "?hello=world")
  assert(response.headers["Content-type"] == "text/html")
  assert(response.body                    == "hello world!")
end
</pre>
